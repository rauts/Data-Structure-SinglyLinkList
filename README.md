### Project Title
**Data-Structure-SinglyLinkList**

### Project Status
Completed


### Project Description
The project is about implementing a custom singly link list data structure in modern `C++17` using object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. To highlight the OOP paradigm, the following programming constructs have been used in developing the project. However, the list may grow or change depending on available resources (e.g. time) in the future:

- Class
- Template
- Encapsulation
- Design pattern


### Usage
Both header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files can be found in the folder `SinglyLinkList`. 

Users are requested to compile and build the codes in `Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 (Version 16.6.3.)` as I have successfully built the whole project in this version of MSVS IDE. 

Since the test codes are also provided in the same folder, users are encouraged to play with the test codes to enhance your understanding about the codes. Users are also encouraged to add more tests codes to increase the robustness of the current implementations as well. 

Hands of suggestions, comments, feedback or colaboration will be highly appreciated.

### Acknowledgement

The course `Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms in C++` in Pluralsight was very helpful to understand problems and to generate ideas to implement own custom data structures. I would like to thank instructor `Giovanni Dicanio` and `Pluralsight` for creating a very useful course.
